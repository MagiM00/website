# How to install Geany Dark Mode on ARM Linux

### <img src="/img/app-icons/Geany Dark Mode/icon-64.png" height=32> ***[Geany Dark Mode](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/tree/master/apps/Geany%20Dark%20Mode)***

```
Proper appearance theme for the Geany text editor.
Geany's default color scheme looks horrible. Fortunately, this app will make it look good.
By default, this will apply the "spyder-dark" theme, (Botspot's favorite!), but it will also install many other themes to try out as well. To switch themes in Geany: View -> Change Color Scheme.
```
