### <img src="/img/app-icons/Windows Screensavers/icon-64.png" height=32> ***[Windows Screensavers](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/tree/master/apps/Windows%20Screensavers)***
https://github.com/Botspot/Screensavers - Botspot<br />
ARM32 ONLY - 2125 Users!
```
14 Windows screensavers that run well on Raspberry Pi.

Once installed, you can launch Botspot's Screensavers GUI from:
Menu -> Preferences -> Windows Screensavers.
To run in terminal: ~/Screensavers/gui

Preview a screensaver, change its settings, and enable it to run after a specified duration of inactivity. The screensaver will not start while audio is playing.

Note: If you don't have Wine installed, this app will install it for you.

In addition to the Windows Screensavers, Botspot's Screensaver GUI also allows convenient installation of GPU-accelerated Xscreensaver, preset to enable the best ones out of 230 screensavers.
