Blockbench is a free, modern model editor for low-poly and boxy models with pixel art textures. Models can be exported into standardized formats, to be shared, rendered, 3D-printed, or used in game engines. There are also multiple dedicated formats for Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition with format-specific features.

To run:
Menu -> Programming -> Blockbench
To run in a terminal:
/opt/Blockbench/blockbench
```
