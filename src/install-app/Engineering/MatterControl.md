MatterControl is an all-in-one program to create, edit, slice, and manage your 3D prints.
While not quite as popular as Cura or PrusaSlicer, this program offers features and supports printers that alternative programs don't.

To run: Menu -> Accessories -> MatterControl
To run in a terminal: mattercontrol
Please note that when the window first opens that it will be black. Resizing or maximizing the window will solve this problem.
```
