DDRaceNetwork is a 2D cooperative platformer experience. Work together with up to 64 people and push your way through maps.
You will see the best and worst in your teammates when they save you from certain death or leave you behind in the dust.
We've developed DDNet for over 7 years now and made it greater than ever!
It has been free-to-play and free-to-win since development started and will always stay free.
It's also open source, so everyone is invited to help improve it with great new ideas!

To run: Menu -> Games -> DDnet

If you want to host an online Server you have to activate Port Forwarding in your Router Settings. 
You have to create a Port Forwarding with the protocol udp and the Port of your Server (standard is 8303) 
```
