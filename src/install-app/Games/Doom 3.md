Doom 3 is a 2004 horror first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Activision.
In this game a massive demonic invasion has overwhelmed the Union Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility, leaving only chaos and horror in its wake.
As one of only a few survivors, you must fight your way to hell and back against a horde of evil monsters.
