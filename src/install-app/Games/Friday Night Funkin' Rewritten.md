Friday Night Funkin’ is a musical rhythm game where you compete in freestyle music battles.
The father of your girlfriend is always a pain, because no matter what you do, you may never be good enough for his daughter. In Friday Night Funkin, you are the "Boyfriend", and this cliché comes together in a colorful and musical mash. The fun of Friday and the stress of meeting your significant other's father will make your knees shake and your heart tingle.

This version is entirely re-written in an engine called LOVE2D
