Change Chromium versions easily.
Chromium 65, 72, 74, 78, 84, 86, 88, 92, and 95.
Uninstall the app to go back to the latest Chromium version available.
Beware that downgrading Chromium versions can mess up your config folder. To be safe, this app makes a backup of Chromium's config folder. When uninstalling, you will have the opportunity to restore the backup config folder.
Using older browser versions can be a security risk, proceed with caution.

All deb files are downloaded from https://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/c/chromium-browser
