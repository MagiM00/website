Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built
from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from
Mozilla's code a number of years ago, with carefully selected
features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user
experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of
extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Pale Moon
To run in terminal: palemoon
