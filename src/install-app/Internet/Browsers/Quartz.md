A useful fast Web Browser for Windows and Linux written in pyqt5 webkit.

This browser is aimed at ease of use, faster page loading, very short startup time.

This has minimal settings to avoid confusion.Yet it has most useful settings, such as load images on/off, javascript on/off, change font.

To save pages to read later, print feature can be used to save as pdf. And it can also export the whole page as png image.
