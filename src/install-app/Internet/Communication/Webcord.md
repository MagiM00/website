### <img src="/img/app-icons/Webcord/icon-64.png" height=32> ***[Webcord](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/tree/master/apps/Webcord)***
https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord/ - Discord app by SpacingBat3<br />
ARM32/ARM64 - 35,400 Users!!
```
Fast Discord client for ARM that mimics the official Discord client.
The app runs independent to chromium and can be hidden to the system tray unlike other solutions out there.
To run: Menu -> Internet -> WebCord.
To run in a terminal: webcord
This client is not officially provided or supported by Discord and technically violates ToS, use at your own risk
Made by SpacingBat3 on Github with care :)
```
