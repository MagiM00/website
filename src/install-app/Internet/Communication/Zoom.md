Zoom video calls on the Raspberry Pi.
This is the full desktop app, so you can do virtual backgrounds and Gallery View!
This works by running the 32-bit x86 Zoom Linux app inside the box86 emulator.
Performance is good enough on the Pi4. Turning off HD video in Zoom's settings is recommended.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Zoom
To run in a terminal: ~/zoom/runzoom.sh
```
