Electron Fiddle lets you create and play with small Electron experiments. 

It greets you with a quick-start template after opening â€“ change a few things, choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around.
Then, save your Fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder.
Once pushed to GitHub, anyone can quickly try your Fiddle out by just entering it in the address bar.

Run from menu: Menu -> Accesories -> Electron Fiddle
Run from Terminal: electron-fiddle
```
