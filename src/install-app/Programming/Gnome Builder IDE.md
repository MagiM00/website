Builder is an actively developed Integrated Development Environment for GNOME.
It combines integrated support for essential GNOME technologies such as GTK+, GLib, and GNOME APIs with features that any developer will appreciate, like syntax highlighting and snippets.

You can rely on predictable releases of Builder with each new release of GNOME every six months.
