Enjoy learning computer programming with drag-n-drop blocks!
This is Raspberry Pi's official electron build of Scratch 3 and it runs offline.
To run: Menu -> Programming -> Scratch 3
To run in a terminal: /usr/lib/scratch3/scratch-desktop
Note: Consider trying Turbowarp or Scratch 2 - both run faster than this version.
