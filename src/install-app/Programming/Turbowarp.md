Scratch 3 Desktop, but runs much faster. Also known as 'TurboWarp'
TurboWarp is a Scratch mod that compiles projects to JavaScript to make them run really fast. Also has dark mode, addons, and more. It even works when you're offline, just like the original Scratch Desktop.

To run: Menu -> Programming -> TurboWarp
