Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft.
Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git
It supports most popular coding languages including Python, JavaScript, and more.
Note: If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, you don't need to install this app. Just run "sudo apt install code" in the terminal. Pi-Apps will still continue to ship VSCode so that non-PiOS users can still have access to it.
