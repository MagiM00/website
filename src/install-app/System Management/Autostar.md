Simple utility to make programs run on boot. The sky's the limit.
People use this to:
- Launch a website automatically, on boot.
- Start a backup.
- Launch your favorite apps on boot so they are ready to use sooner.
- See what other apps have added autostart entries, and customize/disable them.

To run: Menu -> Preferences -> AutoStar
To run in terminal: ~/autostar/main.sh
```
