BleachBit is a free and open-source disk space cleaner, privacy manager, and computer system optimizer. Not outdated like the APT repo's BleachBit.

Like CCleaner on Windows, BleachBit frees space by deleting unimportant files and helps maintain your privacy by deleting sensitive data. 
And, just like CCleaner, thereâ€™s more you can do with BleachBit than just clicking a single button.

Better than free, BleachBit is open source.

Comparison to APT version:
- Nicer GUI look
- With Abort function
- With many function not included in APT version (Shred path from clipboard,make chaff and etc)
- Clean deeper
- Official dark theme support
- Support showing debug messages
```
