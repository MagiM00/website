Monitor your Raspberry Pi using a web browser on another computer.
This is a background service that hosts a website at <your Pi's IP address>:6969. Using any computer on your local network, you can go to that website and view many useful statistics. (And some useless ones too)

For testing purposes, you can look at the website from the Pi itself by launching Chromium browser and going to http://localhost:6969

As mentioned earlier, the website is only visible to computers in the local network.
