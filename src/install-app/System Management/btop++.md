Awesome terminal resource monitor and task manager, similar to htop.

Run from Terminal: btop

btop shows CPU, memory, network, and disk usage, along with a task manager.
btop is also very user customizable, with different layouts and ways of displaying CPU, memory, network and disk usage.

If you want to look at screenshots of btop, go to the GitHub README.
