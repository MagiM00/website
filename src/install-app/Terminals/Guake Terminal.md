Guake is a top-down terminal, inspirated by the famous terminal used in Quake.

You can show and hide your terminal with a single key stroke, execute a command, and then go back to your previous task without breaking your workflow.

To run: Press F12. (Guake runs automatically on startup)
To run manually: Menu -> System Tools -> Guake Terminal
To run in a terminal: guake
```
