Futuristic hacker terminal
Inspired from Hollywood, this terminal is beautiful to look at and will impress your friends. It's a fully-functional bash terminal, system monitor, file manager, and on-screen keyboard, all in one fullscreen window.
Oh, and it has sound effects.
To run: Menu -> System Tools -> eDEX-UI. This new version loads in about 10 seconds! (instead of 2 minutes like Novaspirit's old version)

To exit eDEX-UI, press Alt+F4, or run this command in the terminal: exit
Change settings with Ctrl+Shift+S.
View all keyboard shortcuts with Ctrl+Shift+K.

Novaspirit Tech made an excellent walkthrough video a while ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJOAmYlDQuM
