Desktop app to manage Duino-Coin miners and tools.

You can upload the code to any Arduino board, mine with all the boards or with the ones you choose, mine with the PC (choosing the cores you want), and much more.
You can also connect to your official wallet and perform any operation without leaving the application, as well as see the live status of the network and servers.
This development makes everything related to DuinoCoin even easier, based exclusively on the official tools.

ElectronJs has been used for this purpose.
