FF Multi Converter is a simple graphical application for Linux which enables you to convert audio,
video, image and document files.

It uses FFmpeg for audio/video files, the ImageMagick software suite for image conversions and
unoconv for document files.

The goal of FF Multi Converter is to gather the most popular multimedia types in one application
and provide conversion options for them easily through a user-friendly graphical interface.

Run from Menu: Menu -> Accesories -> FF Multi Converter
Run from Terminal: ffmulticonverter
```
