Connect and control your Android smartphone.
This is similar to a remote desktop, where you can view the device's screen and navigate it normally.

To run: Menu -> System Tools -> Scrcpy
To run in a terminal: scrcpy

Notes:
- For more info, run "scrcpy --help"
- The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).
- Make sure you enabled ADB debugging on your device.
- The device needs to be connected to the same local network, or via USB.
- On some devices, you also need to enable an additional option to control it using keyboard and mouse.
- If you have issues, try to run the app a couple of times through Terminal.
```
