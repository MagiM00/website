Install Windows 10 or Windows 11 on a Raspberry Pi SD card.
This tool is a 100% legal way to use any Debian or Ubuntu Linux operating system to flash a RPi's SD card with the necessary files to run Windows 10 or 11.

Usage is simple:
- Choose an operating system version. (Windows 11, Windows 10, Custom version)
- Choose what model Pi will be running Windows. (RPi4 or RPi3)
- Choose a language.
- Choose a storage drive to flash.
- Click Flash.
It's as simple as that. WoR-flasher takes care of the rest - downloading hundreds of files from Microsoft, generating a Windows image with them, importing the custom RPi drivers, enabling the WinPE environment, and much more. When finished, WoR-flasher will tell you exactly what to do next.

To run: Menu -> Accessories -> WoR-Flasher
To run the graphical interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor-gui.sh
To run the command-line interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor.sh

If you encounter problems, we recommend you run WoR-flasher in a terminal to catch any errors.
