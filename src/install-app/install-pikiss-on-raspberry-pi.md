> ATTENTION! The pi-kiss maintainer only uses edge versions of software. This means that if you installed something and it works, it does not mean that it will work in the future. Currently only Bullseye is supported, operation on Buster and similar systems is not guaranteed. Do not rush to remove your programs, you may not be able to install them in the future.

## Compatibility
For the best chance of this working, we recommend using the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), which is currently version **Bookworm**.
Raspberry Pi OS has 32-bit and 64-bit variants, both of which will run on most Raspberry Pi computers, including the Pi 3, Pi 4, and Pi5.
piKiss will run on either PiOS 32-bit or 64-bit.
